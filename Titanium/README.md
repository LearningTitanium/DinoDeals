## Android Instructions

You can compile and run this program from within the Titanium IDE or by
using the Titanium command-line tools. For the latter, simply run the
following command from your terminal:

    $ titanium run --dir=~/path/to/project --platform=android --android=/path/to/android-sdk

> Using the command-line tools should force Titanium to launch the built
> application on a running emulator, instead of creating and launching a
> new AVD.
